Sup folks! Another project testing React but with some more complexity and fun, lots of fun really. I was following courses until I got my hands over useState. I couldn't wait anymore watching people code and doing challenges. So I created this, both a library for keep track of your favourite games and a presentation card. Wait there Goni! Do you mean I can have a handy resource to show my friends which games they have to play before they die?

Hmmm, suuuure little voice in my head. Allright, let's have some fun. Now, seriously, i'm excited as always to begin a new project, new challenges, new bugs, but also new "a-ha!" moments, and lots of fun playing with the design. Let's see what i'm working on here:

# What I'm learning on here

- React Router (v6).
- Fetch API on React and integration with state, efects, props.
- Material Design.
- Vite builder.
- Extracting services from components.

# RAWG

"RAWG is the largest video game database and game discovery service." As it's said in the API docs. It don't have a fancy authentication, it's pretty straightforward. Ideal for a begginer like me, it simplifies everything and lets me to focus on other thigs as ui design, routing, basic ux. It, unfortunatelly, simplifies too some of the data I wanted to have, as game covers. But, as I said before it's ideal for now.
